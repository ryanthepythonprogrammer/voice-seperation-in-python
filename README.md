# voice-seperation-in-python
I have made project that takes sound files in .wav format and then seperates the voices. Old name acapellabot.py ; new name gae.py

all instructions are in gae.py. gae.py is the main program. Run it as python gae.py --data "put data here" --batch 32 --weights ("put weights file here")

it works best on wav file but try your luck with mp3
